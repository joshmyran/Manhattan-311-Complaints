### Areas of Manhattan With More Noise Complaints
The areas of Manhattan that had the largest number of 311 noise complaints are more northern neighborhoods such as the Upper West Side and Upper Manhattan, as well as more downtown neighborhoods such as the West Village and SoHo. These areas are more dense than other parts of Manhattan, and are generally more residential neighborhoods. These more residential neighborhoods are more likely to receive noise complaints, rather than neighborhoods that are heavy in commercial activity and office space. People are sleeping, eating, cooking, and doing their daily activities in their homes and do not want to be disturbed by noise. 
### Noise Complaints Descriptor Trends
Some trends that I noticed are that construction and party/music noise complaints seem to occur all over the city extensively. They are by far the most called-in complaints compared to the four complaints studied; animal, ice cream truck, party, and construction noise complaints. Ice cream truck noise complaints are more conglomerated around busy streets, like Central Park West street running alongside Central Park. These complaints also happen to be near residential areas, for example the surrounding areas of Central Park, rather than other busy areas that aren't heavy residential areas. Animal noise complaints aren't extensive throughout the city, and there isn't a particular trend as to areas with a higher or lower amount of noise complaints.
### Additional Data
![Manhattan Percentage of Buildings Built Before 1940](https://github.com/joshmyran/Manhattan-311-Complaints/blob/50ca79820a80c47bea8505489dbedf55e18a3b6c/Graduated%20Map%20of%20311%20Complaints%20by%20NTA%20-%20Layout.png)
For the additional data, I studied the percentage of buildings within each area code that were built before 1940. There does seem to be similarities between the number of 311 complaints and a higher percentage of buildings built before 1940. I would assume that older buildings need more repairs and construction done to maintain them, increasing the amount of construction within an older neighborhood and therefore increasing construction noise complaints. Neighborhoods with a high percentage of older buildings and a higher amount of 311 complaints include the Upper West Side, the West Village, and SoHo.
